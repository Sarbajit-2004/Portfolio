  "about": "I\u2019m an AI/ML and Full-Stack Engineer passionate about turning complex ideas into real, deployable products. I enjoy blending intelligent automation with clean design \u2014 whether it\u2019s a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, or a machine-learning model that actually solves a user\u2019s problem. My interests lie at the intersection of applied AI, cybersecurity, and system design. I love exploring how data, models, and human creativity can work together to build experiences that are fast, meaningful, and reliable. Outside of coding, I spend time experimenting with visual design and mentoring peers to explore the tech-entrepreneurial side of engineering.",
